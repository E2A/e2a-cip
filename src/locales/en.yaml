    **The Four Domains of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Programming**
    There are various models to help guide the design or strengthening of family planning and reproductive health programs—be at the national level or local community. The model used here is a slightly modified version of EngenderHealth’s Supply–Enabling Environment–Demand (SEED)™ Programming Model. The strength of this model is that it takes a holistic approach to programming. The model considers the following domains:
    - the supply of services that are available, including their quality, accessibility, acceptability, and affordability
    - the level and type of demand for services that exists in communities
    - the factors in the environment that enable or constrain supply and demand

    \
    The E2A version includes an additional domain, coordination, which it sees as key in maximizing synergy and ensuring synchronization between the various components that contribute to improved family planning and reproductive health outcomes. Each of these four domains are explained more fully below.
  activityTypes:
    type1:
      title: Supply
      # do not translate
      key: supply
      body: |-
        Health services are essential to any family planning or reproductive health program. Many factors influence the quality of services. For the purposes of the TARP, any proposed activities that seek to improve the quality, accessibility, acceptability, and affordability of services would fall under this domain. These activities can include:
        - Training staff to offer adolescent and youth friendly services or to increase their knowledge or skills in the provision of FP/RH services, including expanding method choice
        - Efforts to increase the number of health personnel in facilities
        - Efforts to improve management and increase staff involvement in decision-making at health facilities
        - Initiatives to improve the physical environment (infrastructure) of the health facilities. This can include changes to the building itself, or ensuring access to power and water
        - Efforts to expand services beyond the health facilities to reach young people, including increasing the number of community-based service delivery points, like mobile and household-level outreach
        - Initiatives to increase the quality of the data collected at facilities, especially age and sex disaggregated data
        - Ensuring that health facilities have all the medicines, family planning methods, and equipment they need
        - Reducing or eliminating any cost barriers (whether sanctioned or not)
        - Initiatives to implement a quality and performance improvement methodology with staff
        - Implementing and monitoring referrals systems
        - Promoting efforts to include community representatives, including youth, on committees that oversee or manage health facility activities, outcomes, or address complaints
        - Supporting supervision from local, district, provincial, or national Ministry of Health officials
        - The integration of family planning services within other services, like antenatal care, post-partum care, or HIV services
    type2:
      title: Demand
      # do not translate
      key: demand
      body: |-
        Many factors can influence the demand for family planning and reproductive health services in communities. These include knowledge about services, social norms regarding the acceptability of family planning utilization, and misconceptions about family planning methods. A variety of approaches using mass media, interpersonal outreach, small-group education, social marketing, and home-based outreach can all be used. It is best if efforts to influence demand are well coordinated within a community, district, province, or country. Any activities in your plan that address demand factors would fall under this domain. These activities can include:
        - Community outreach activities to increase knowledge about the availability of family planning services
        - Educational efforts to address misconceptions or biases regarding family planning methods
        - Initiatives to promote positive male involvement in family planning
        - Educational efforts to increase knowledge of family planning methods
        - Campaigns to reduce teenage pregnancy or promote birth spacing
        - Peer education efforts to provide information and motivate peers to utilize services
        - The use of mass media to convey messages about the health benefits of family planning or to influence social norms
        - Efforts to promote family communication about family planning and reproductive health
    type3:
      title: Enabling environment
      # do not translate
      key: enablingEnvironment
      body: |-
        One of the advantages of the SEED Model is that it takes into consideration the specific context in which family planning services are demanded and delivered. Cultural, political, economic, and religious factors affect how health services function and the social norms around those services. An Enabling Environment for health requires “equitable policies; adequate resources; good governance, management, and accountability; supportive social and cultural norms; and gender equity.”[^1] Any activity that attempts to influence the wider context of family planning programming would fall under this domain. These activities can include:
        - Advocacy to promote policies and guidelines that are supportive of AYRH
        - Regulatory factors that affect the availability of specific family planning methods within a country
        - Efforts to promote policies that increase youth access to family planning, both in facility-based and community settings
        - Campaigns to address social norms regarding the appropriateness of contraceptives for young people
        - Working with religious leaders to increase their support for AYRH
        - Advocacy for family life education
        - Initiatives to address gender norms and actions that affect contraceptive utilization, including couple communication, shared decision-making, and even reproductive coercion
        - Advocacy with governments, multi-lateral organizations, and donor partners to support adequate funding for AYRH

      title: Coordination
      # do not translate
      key: coordination
      body: |-
        Coordination involves deliberate and planned collaboration among all the stakeholders involved in supply, demand, and creating an enabling environment to maximize the often-limited resources to achieve desired family planning and reproductive health outcomes. Important coordination activities include:
        - Assessments to gain a comprehensive, contextual understanding of the challenges to achieving AYRH
        - Building the capacity of partners, especially young people
        - Efforts to involve youth in steering and technical committees related to family planning and reproductive health
        - Promoting strong leadership, to set the agenda, manage relationships, and mobilize stakeholder action
        - Involving all sectors of the health system (and beyond) in coordination, including health services, human resources, finances, managers and planners, community health, health information specialists, and logistics
        - Support for the processes of coordination, including meetings, information-sharing, the development of work plans, etc.
        - Establishing transparent, user-friendly monitoring and evaluation systems

        **Why It Matters**
        One size does not fit all. Young people can vary substantially in their life experiences. The term “adolescents and youth” encompasses young people, ages 15–24, who may be...

        * just beginning to explore relationships
        * unmarried or married
        * without children
        * first-time parents
        * have multiple children

        The term also includes young people who may be living with HIV, have access to health information and supportive parents, or struggle to make sense of their feelings with little information or support. 

        \
        **Adolescent- and youth-friendly services for both young men and women commonly includes:**
        * safe and affordable contraceptive methods 
        * prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and care for other STIs
        * the provision of accurate health information
        * sensitive counselling and care for overall well-being

        \
        **Services may also include:**
        * youth-friendly obstetric and antenatal care for pregnant girls and women
        * post-abortion care
        * prevention, detection, and counselling for gender-based violence
        * prevention, detection, and treatment for cervical cancer

        \
        **Features of Adolescent-Friendly Services**
        1. **Accessible**: Adolescents are able to obtain the health services that are available.
        2. **Acceptable:** Adolescents are willing to obtain the health services that are available.
        3. **Equitable:** All adolescents, not just selected groups, are able to obtain the health services that are available.
        4. **Appropriate:** The right health services (i.e. the ones they need) are provided to them.
        5. **Effective:** The right health services are provided in the right way, and make a positive contribution to their health.

        \
        **Suggested Activities**
        Based on WHO’s global standards for youth-friendly services, health facilities should strive to:[^7]

        
        1. Have systems in place to **ensure adolescents are knowledgeable about their own health—and where and when to obtain health services.**
        2. Implement strategies to **ensure community support**. Parents, guardians and other community members and community organizations should recognize the value of providing health services to adolescents and support such provision and the utilization of services by adolescents.
        3. **Provide an appropriate package of services.** The health facility provides a package of information, counselling, diagnostic, treatment and care services that fulfils the needs of all adolescents. Services are provided in the facility and through referral linkages and community-based outreach.
        4. **Promote health providers’ competencies.** Health-care providers should demonstrate the technical competence required to provide effective health services to adolescents. Both healthcare providers and support staff should respect, protect, and fulfil adolescents’ access to information, privacy, confidentiality, non-discrimination, and non-judgmental care and respect.
        5. **Promote ‘welcoming’ health facilities.** The health facility should have convenient operating hours, a welcoming and clean environment, and maintain privacy and confidentiality. It should have the equipment, medicines, supplies, and technology needed to ensure effective service provision to adolescents.
        6. **Guarantee equity and non-discrimination.** The health facility should provide quality services to all adolescents irrespective of their ability to pay, age, sex, marital status, education level, ethnic origin, or other characteristics.
        7. **Collect data to improve quality.** The health facility should collect, analyze and use data on service utilization and quality of care, disaggregated by age and sex, to support quality improvement. Health facility staff should be supported to participate in continuous quality improvement.
        8. **Enable adolescents’ participation.** Adolescents should be involved in the planning, monitoring and evaluation of health services and in decisions regarding their own care, as well as in certain appropriate aspects of service provision.

        **Why It Matters**
        Sixteen million adolescents (ages 15-19) give birth each year. Most live in low- and middle-income countries. Many of these pregnancies are intended. Others are mistimed. Twenty-three million adolescents would like to use contraception but currently do not. Early and mistimed pregnancies may result in maternal morbidities and death, and lead to social consequences that limit the potential of young women.
        
        Many barriers exist for adolescents who may want to use contraception to delay a first pregnancy or space subsequent pregnancies—restrictive laws limiting contraceptive choice, poorly implemented policies, and social norms, including beliefs held by providers and communities about what kinds of contraception, if any, are appropriate for young people. Compounding these issues, young people may not know where to get affordable contraception, may feel stigmatized due to their own sexual behavior, may not have a choice, or, in the case of marriage, may feel pressure to demonstrate their fertility.[^1]
        
        Adolescent and youth reproductive health (AYRH) services related to contraception have quality counseling as their centerpiece. The objective of this counseling is to ensure that young people are aware of the voluntary nature of contraceptive use and knowledgeable of the full range of contraceptive options available to them.
          
        Quality counseling, including expanded method choice, should empower young people to choose their preferred method and switch methods should they experience undesirable side-effects. Expanding contraceptive choice aligns with the World Health Organization’s third norm for improved quality of healthcare for adolescents (WHO, 2015). Any adolescent can use any contraceptive method according to the WHO’s Medical Eligibility Criteria for contraceptive use. Age alone does not constitute a contraindication to the use of contraceptive methods.

        \
        **A Full Range of Contraceptive Methods for Young People Should Include the Following:**

        * Long-acting, reversible methods (LARCs), such as contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs)
        * Short-term contraceptives, such as injections, combined oral contraceptive pills, and progestin-only oral contraceptives
        * Barrier methods, such as male condoms and female condoms
        * Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) method
        * Emergency contraceptive pills
        * Fertility awareness

        \
        **Suggested Activities**

        The following activities promote expanded contraceptive choice for adolescents and youth:

        1. **Ensure the availability of a full range of contraceptive methods**
            - Establish an effective system for providing a full range of contraceptive products—to enable young people to choose, access, and use the best contraceptive method for their needs, thus minimizing discontinuation and improving satisfaction.
            - Address provider misconceptions and biases as needed to ensure providers are aware of and able to provide the full range of contraceptive methods to young people.
          \
          *Spotlight on LARCs*
          \
          *While most AYRH programs provide barrier and short-term contraceptive methods, there is little to no emphasis on improving young people’s access to, and use of, LARCs—one of the most effective contraceptive methods. This is often due to bias or lack of knowledge on the part of health care providers, who may perceive LARCs to be more appropriate for older women and couples who wish to space or limit their pregnancies.*
          \
          *LARCs are especially useful to adolescents and youth because of their lower rates of method discontinuation or user error. In addition to their effectiveness and ease of use, LARCs can help address youth concerns about privacy and confidentiality, since they require little user follow-up and are long-lasting.*
        2. **Ensure service providers have the required competences to deliver youth-friendly contraceptive services**
            - Train health care providers on contraceptive technologies, including those related to LARCs; the WHO medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use; and WHO provider competencies for adolescent and youth friendly services.
            - Conduct values clarification exercises to address provider bias.
            - Provide pre-service and in-services training for health care providers on adolescent- and youth-friendly services.
            - Provide supportive supervision, mentorship programs, and job aids to encourage providers to deliver youth-friendly services.
        3. **Enable adolescents and youth to access information and counseling on a full range of contraceptive methods**
            - To ensure informed choice, provide comprehensive information and counselling that:
              - focuses on the unique concerns and needs of adolescents and youth
              - considers their fertility intentions
              - addresses myths and misconceptions
              - promotes body literacy, which is essential for effective contraception use and is the cornerstone of empowerment in the context of family planning/reproductive health
            - Ensure counselling services protect young clients’ confidentiality and privacy.
            - Using the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria, ensure young clients do not have any medical issues that may prevent them from using specific contraceptive methods.
        4. **Create an enabling environment that encourages adolescents and young people to make their own choices related to contraception:**
            - Ensure community support for young people’s demand of, access to, and use of the full range of contraceptive methods.
            - Support laws, policies, and guidelines that guarantee all access to contraceptive information, products, and services for all adolescents and youth.
            - Implement interventions to address gender norms that limit young people’s contraceptive use

        **Why It Matters**
        The advantages of multi-sectoral coordination, if thoughtfully and carefully done, can achieve a policy outcome, such as increasing resources brought to bear to address a health problem. These resources can include: 
        - Expertise
        - human resources
        - material and financial resources
        - greater coverage of programs
        - increased social and political support for solutions

        AYRH challenges are complex, implicating social norms, education, economic disparity, gender inequality, and environmental factors.[^2] The response to AYRH challenges must be equally comprehensive. Well-planned, thoughtful multi-sectoral coordination can provide a holistic approach to addressing AYRH issues and help increase the probability of the success of the response.

        Evidence suggests programs that are implemented in a coordinated way across multiple sectors are more effective in realizing adolescents’ health and wellbeing,[^3] and contributing to the realization of the objectives of the economic and education sectors of society.[^4] A recent systematic review to identify insights and evidence gaps in girl-centered programs suggests that multi-sectoral programs tend to outperform single-sector programs.[^5]

        \
        **Keys to Planning Successful Multi-Sectoral Collaboration**

        - A comprehensive, contextual understanding of the problem 
        - Recognition of the value of engaging diverse stakeholders from various sectors in the policy process and capitalizing on the particular strengths of individual stakeholders
        - Buy-in and commitment from all stakeholders 
        - Strong leadership—to set the agenda, manage relationships, and mobilize stakeholder action
        - The ability to effectively tailor messages and approaches to each stakeholder to increase influence
        - Communication of the benefits of collaboration to each sector and partner to jointly achieve the priority AYRH goal
        - Commitment of adequate resources to ensure capacity building, effective cross-sectoral linkages, and coordination between sectors at every level of implementation. 

        \
        The probability of the success of multi-sectoral collaborations increases substantially when it is supported, highly incentivized, or mandated.

        \
        **Suggested Activities**
        The following approaches for effective multi- and inter-sectoral coordination are recommended by the World Health Organization, West African Health Organization, the Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health and Wellbeing:

        - **Adopt evidence-based multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral approaches**[^7] that engage the education, youth, media, finance, justice, and social protection sectors to create a systematic package of complementary services that build on one another’s strengths and enhance synergies
        - **Involve multiple sectors in steering and technical committees that serve youth in the development of national youth policies and strategies, including AYRH.** National strategies are more likely to be effectively implemented if all relevant sectors have participated in developing them and negotiating for their adoption. WAHO recommends that the process of developing a national adolescent and youth health strategy should start with identifying, mapping, and coordinating with all adolescent actors, including AYRH, in the country.[^8]
        - **Build the capacity of key AYRH actors to ensure that multi- and inter-sectoral interventions are efficient and effective.** Inter- and cross-sectoral programs and interventions are complex and require that each sector be technically competent and able to manage and coordinate their programs and investments.[^9]
        - **Establish transparent, user-friendly monitoring and evaluation systems and clear accountability mechanisms.** The Global strategy for women’s children’s and adolescents’ health highlights the importance of transparent and accessible data to ensure effective inclusion of stakeholders beyond health care providers.[^10] Effective inter-sectoral coordination for AYRH requires easy access to quality data. Transparent access to data will ensure all stakeholders, including young people, are able to monitor progress and hold decision-makers to account.

        To ensure the relevance, responsiveness, and effectiveness of AYRH programming, it’s critical to meaningfully engage and build the capacity of youth advocates and leaders.
      body: |-
        **Why It Matters**
        Through active participation, young people are empowered to play a vital role in their own development as well as in that of their communities, helping them to learn critical life-skills, develop knowledge on human rights and citizenship, and to promote positive civic action. Adolescent participation is one of WHO’s eight standards that must be attained to improve the quality of health services for adolescents. Young people’s participation must be understood as an essential component to be monitored and evaluated.[^1] 

        \
        **Key Elements of Youth Participation to Advance AYRH**
        - Youth with capabilities and opportunities to seek information 
        - Youth who are able to express their opinions, ideas, and decisions
        - Youth informed and consulted on decisions that pertain to youth (programs and policies)
        - Youth who take an active role in the various steps of designing, implementing, and monitoring a health service or policy
        - Youth with the knowledge, skills, and desire to make informed choices about their reproductive life
        - Youth with the knowledge and skills necessary to hold influential decision-makers accountable

        \
        Youth participation nurtures the skills that are vital for young individuals to promote a thriving civil society sector and functioning democratic institutions, including responsive health systems and services.

        \
        **Suggested activities**

        The following activities effectively build the capacity of youth advocates and leaders and create inclusive processes and platforms for youth participation:

        - **Partner with a diverse range of youth networks, organizations, and individuals:** The term ‘youth’ masks the wide range of experiences, diversity, and needs of young people. Youth engagement efforts should be inclusive to ensure broad representation of perspectives.
        - **Invest in youth leadership development:** Training, coaching, and mentorship efforts, along with capacity-building regarding political and management processes, are essential to effective youth participation.[^5]
        - **Support youth participation in AYRH advocacy.** The past two decades have seen increased youth engagement in health-related advocacy at the global, national, and community levels.[^6] In West Africa, the Young Ambassadors for Family Planning were established to ensure AYRH policies are responsive to their needs and perspectives. Young people need platforms to make sure their voices are heard and that they are able to participate in policy development, implementation and evaluation.
        - **Partner with youth in the planning, monitoring, evaluation, and scale-up of AYRH services and programs.** Involving young people and empowering them as leaders, including as part of health facilities’ governance structures adds value to programs and services and contributes to their sustainability.[^7] The WHO recommends that health care facilities regularly seek adolescent feedback on the services they provide.[^8]
        - **Provide opportunities for youth participation in service provision and project implementation.** Participation opportunities include involvement in peer education and/or counselling programs, pre- and in-service training of providers in YFS delivery, and assessing the quality of available services, among others. Peer programs are probably the most popular and documented approach. Evaluations of peer programs show that the greatest benefits accrue to the peer educators themselves[^9][^10], and are an excellent opportunity to build youth leadership skills, but only achieve modest results in improving the health of youth beneficiaries.[^11][^12] Peer programs appear to be most effective when they capitalize the peer educators’ ability to disseminate information and refer young people to health services and when combined with other evidence-informed practices.
        - **Ensure youth participation in research.** Youth-led participatory action research is an increasingly popular way to promote youth engagement and empowerment. Such youth-led research builds the research and engagement skills of young people, increases their knowledge of their own communities, and enables them to contribute to positive social change and the improvement of health in their communities.
        - **Support and enable youth decision-making about RH/FP.** The health sector should develop and implement policies and guidelines that support adolescent decision-making and informed choice through the provision of accurate, appropriate, and easily understood information on the benefits, risks and alternatives to RH/FP products and services— including the full range of contraceptive methods.
        - **Gather robust data on effective programming for young people,** including youth-led initiatives, and use this information to inform program design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation as well as drive advocacy for programming that supports youth, leadership, and partnership.

        **Why It Matters**
        Family Life Education is an effective, evidence-informed approach with the potential to:
        - empower adolescents and youth
        - Improve and protect young people’s health, well-being, and dignity
        - support young people to develop critical thinking and decision-making skills 
        - promote citizenship 
        - fosters equal, healthy and positive relationships

        \
        Family Life Education focuses on teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects of adolescence, growth and development, and relationships. There exists convincing evidence of the positive effect of Family LIfe Education on reproductive health/family planning, particularly in reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unintended pregnancy.

        \
        **Key Characteristics of an Effective Family Life Education Program**
        - Scientifically accurate
        - Incremental (each lesson builds on the last)
        - Age- and developmentally-appropriate
        - Curriculum-based
        - Comprehensive—to ensure young people can make informed choices about their health
        - Based on a human-rights approach
        - Culturally relevant and context-appropriate
        - Gender-transformative (promoting gender equality)
        - Skills-focused

        \
        **Suggested Activities**
        1. **Build support for Family Life Education**
          The ministries of health, education, youth, gender play critical roles in providing policy and moral national leadership, which is essential in creating a climate that is conducive to Family Life Education.[^1] To garner support at every level, consider the following activities:
            - Use evidence that demonstrate young people’s existing needs within national and local contexts.
            - Use existing international, regional, and local frameworks and international agreements that support Family Life Education
            - Identify key thought leaders to influence support for Family Life Education in their networks and beyond
            - Advocate for sufficient funding for the Family Life Education policy to successfully support its implementation and scale-up
        2. **Involve a broad coalition of stakeholders in planning Family Life Education**
          Ensure multiple constituencies are involved in planning and implementing Family Life Education programs. Coalitions may include school officials, teachers, health care providers, students, religious leaders, community leaders, parents, NGOs, and the media. Broad involvement will help to ensure that community concerns are addressed early in the planning process and that you build societal support for Family Life Education—including sustainability and a sense of ownership.
        3. **Ensure effective coordination**
          National Family LIfe Education programs falter and sometimes fail due to insufficient coordination among stakeholders, including central and local governments, NGOs, and other development partners. Clarity about roles, including responsibility for the implementation of FLE, is vital.
        4. **Ensure the Family Life Education curriculum is responsive to local needs**
          Sometimes a national curriculum is not sufficiently responsive to local needs, especially in areas where there are considerable socio-demographic differences. Using a broad coalition of stakeholders in the planning and implementation processes will help to ensure the curriculum is responsive to local health priorities and in alignment with progressive social norms.
        5. **Ensure adequate monitoring and evaluation systems are in place**
          Mechanisms for evaluating the effectiveness of teachers and assessing the impact of the program on students are important in the success of Family LIfe Education programs.

        Collaborate with community groups and gatekeepers—e.g., young people’s parents and families—to address social norms and create a supportive environment to improve adolescent and youth reproductive health (AYRH).

        Collaborate with community groups and gatekeepers—e.g., young people’s parents and families—to address social norms and create a supportive environment to improve AYRH.
      body: |-
        **Why It Matters**

        Restrictive social norms about AYRH may make young people feel uncomfortable or stigmatized about their own behavior, inhibiting access to knowledge, services, and ultimately healthy decision-making. On the other hand, families and communities that are supportive of AYRH become sources of support to young people and important resources in their continued growth and development. Work with community groups and gatekeepers to challenge and change social norms and harness local systems and structure to provide a supportive environment for AYRH programs and young people to take action.

        \
        **Implementation Considerations**

        There are a variety of useful community engagement approaches. Typically, they involve engaging groups in assessing the identifying pressing AYRH problems in their own communities, prioritizing those problems, developing strategies to address those problems, implementing solutions, monitoring progress, and engaging in advocacy activities to promote AYRH. Like youth participation, community engagement is a process that both utilizes and fosters skills (and systems/structures) that are central to the development of a strong and vibrant civil society sector. This includes:
        - promoting awareness of young people’s opportunities to access knowledge and services
        - engaging communities as partners in ensuring supportive AYRH policies and programs 
        - holding family and community leaders accountable for addressing young people’s needs

        \
        **Suggested Activities**
        While there exists little documented evidence on community-based strategies that effectively result in increased support for AYRH, studies suggest promising outcomes when utilizing the following practices:
        1. **Promote the participation of parents and parent-child communication.** There is often limited communication between adolescents and their parents about issues related to RH/FP, teenage pregnancy, and HIV and AIDS.[^4] Several studies suggest that if parents develop increased receptiveness and skills to communicate with their children about these topics, they will increase communication. It is possible to improve the contents of parent-child conversations by raising awareness of parents and supporting them to challenge the social and cultural norms that restrict communication.[^5][^6]
        2. **Mobilize community leaders.** Involving key community leaders, including religious leaders, can generate stronger community support. More evaluations—of community sensitization programs, especially concerning their impact on RH/FP service uptake by adolescents and youth or in changes in the opinions of community members with regard to AYRH—are needed.[^7]
        3. **Collaborate with community groups.** Community group participation is a promising, high-impact practice influencing individual behaviors and social norms on RH/FP.[^8] It is important that community reflection and dialogue on RH/FP issues be led by individuals from within the community as well as community groups that work with young people. As combined interventions report stronger results on contraceptive knowledge, awareness, and use, community engagement should be:
            - Combined with other social and behavioral change strategies (e.g. engaging the media, interpersonal communication, or counselling), 
            - Combined with investments in improving service provision, or
            - Embedded within larger programs that involve a range of interventions and stakeholders. 
        4. Advocate for the development and implementation of supportive laws and policies. Many governments have made strides in institutionalizing the ability of adolescents and youth to access RH/FP services. However, weak legal and policy frameworks or uneven implementation of these laws hinder young people’s access to these services.[^9] Advocacy is needed to encourage and support governments, implementing partners, and young people themselves to combat legal and policy barriers, including:
            - Policies related to consent, age, and marital status
            - The ability of young people to access the full range of FP methods
            - Availability and Implementation of Family Life Education
            - Youth-friendly services; and supportive laws and policies for AYRH
          Even when enabling laws and policies are in place, governments must be encouraged to exert political will, allocate adequate resources, build capacity to implement those enabling laws and policies, and establish accountability mechanisms.
        5. **Use media campaigns and other forms of social and behavior change communication.** “Edutainment” (entertainment-education programs) can encourage conversations about AYRH, although there have been very few evaluations of this approach’s effect beyond knowledge- building and awareness raising.[^10] Media campaigns alone are insufficient to increase community support for AYRH. They should be implemented as part of a broader strategy that includes other social and norm change interventions, such as engaging men and boys and community mobilization.

        Address the factors that limit girls and young women from having options, encourage boys to take risks, and create barriers to family planning and reproductive health care for both sexes.
        
        Gender equality means that, regardless of sex, individuals should have equal ease of access to resources and opportunities, including civic, religious, political, and economic participation, and decision-making. The needs, aspirations, and behaviors or young men and women are equally valued. In terms of health, gender equality means that all young people should have access to quality FP/RH information and health care that is responsive to their specific needs, lifestage or experience, and cultural and social context.

        Address the factors that limit girls and young women from having options, encourage boys to take risks, and create barriers to family planning and reproductive health care for both sexes.
      body: |-
        **Why It Matters**
        It is well documented that gender inequality has a significant and negative impact on a range of reproductive health outcomes. Gender and age-related norms often limit girls’ decision-making ability and options, while increasing their risk for gender-based violence, HIV, and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. Early/child/forced marriage represents one of the greatest violations of human rights, fundamentally compromising girls’ futures and their health. Gender norms regarding masculinity may encourage young men and boys to take risks and discourage them from seeking health care, making them more vulnerable, for example, to HIV mortality. 

        \
        Social and gender norms also support the notion that FP and RH are female spheres of responsibility—placing disproportionate burden on girls and young women for reproductive health action, while preventing boys and men from owning their own reproductive health. 
        
        \
        **Suggested Activities**
        1. **Support programs that encourage young people to examine, discuss, and question gender norms and values.** Family Life Education programs that use curricula with an explicit focus on gender throughout are more effective than curricula that do not directly address gender norms. Creating a space for young people to engage with one another through structured and participatory educational sessions that systematically examine and question cultural norms about gender is an effective way to motivate young people to consider their behavior, responsibilities, relationships, and health.
        2. **Improve adolescent girls’ access to school and support their retention.** Investments that enable girls to stay in school, especially secondary school, have wide, long- term benefits on the health and development of individuals, families, and communities. Evidence shows strong, positive linkages between girls’ education and healthier behaviors. [2] Strategies that improve girl’s participation in school include: 
            - challenging social norms that undermine girls and their education 
            - improving the quality and safety of the school environment 
            - providing economic incentives for sending girls to school and keeping them there
            - promoting quality education, and linking health programs with schools.[^3]
        3. **Engage men and boys to promote gender equity.** An increasing number of FP/RH programs address inequities and negative gender norms and behaviors by engaging men and boys through a participatory group education and dialogue, media campaigns, and digital health applications, as well as activities to mobilize the community at large. Other strategies may include working through multiple non-clinic, informal settings, such as mobile outreach, community health workers, drug shops and pharmacies, and social marketing. Integrated interventions that combine community group engagement, media-focused activities, interpersonal education, and health care targeted to men and boys yield promising results for gender equity.[^4]
        4. **Building young people’s FP/RH-related capacities and assets.** Young people must be able to draw on their own knowledge, skills and assets to take timely and desired action about their health.[5] Working with girls to build these resources is a cornerstone of gender-based programming, including women’s empowerment and male involvement. Activities are often group-based and use participatory methodologies to create safe, shared spaces for youth to learn about RH/FP issues, develop life skills and form critical social networks. Many programs also strengthen young people’s economic resources, by including financial literacy, vocational training and savings mechanisms. While attention to girls’ and young women is essential, broader youth development and capacity building approaches, including those that work with both girls and boys together, can also support AYRH-related empowerment. For example, Positive Youth Development engages young people together with their families, communities and/or government build capacities, assets and competencies, foster healthy relationships, strengthen the environment, and transform systems benefits.[6]
        5. **Eliminate gender-based violence (GBV) against girls and young women.** Violence and harmful practices, driven by underlying power and gender inequalities, affect girls and women throughout their lives and directly influence their reproductive health. GBV responses within FP/RH programs can include: 
            - strengthening health providers’ capacity to screen for, and respond to, GBV—but only where services exist
            - helping to build a services infrastructure for survivors, including health services, psycho-social support, and legal services 
            - working with communities to challenge and change harmful gender norms and practices and lower their tolerance to violence 
            - engaging girls and boys to influence their attitudes about gender and nonviolence. In some countries and contexts, specific harmful practices, such as female genital cutting/mutilation and child marriage should also be addressed
        6. **Eliminate child/early/forced marriage.** In several countries, marrying before age 18 is allowed by law. Even in countries where early marriage is illegal, laws are poorly enforced. In some areas, girls are expected to marry and have children during adolescence, often before they are physically or mentally ready to do so. While establishment and enforcement of a legal minimum age of marriage is an important step to ending child marriage, it is just one part of a comprehensive child protection approach to ensuring the wellbeing of girls. Other necessary steps involve working with women and men,[7] community leaders, and other stakeholders to challenge and change social norms that encourage early marriage; engaging in girls’ empowerment activities; and disseminating information in all sectors of society about laws and policies supporting the rights of children.

    stepsTitle: Ways to Advocate
    steps:
      step1:
        title: Share the results of this exercise
        blurb: |-
          One purposes of this exercise is to give you a sense of the extent to which your plan addresses the needs of youth in your country and the extent to which your plan is using EIPs. Share the results of what you have learned. Use the results page to prepare a presentation or report for the rest of your planning group, the Ministry of Health or your local NGO. Use the graphs that depict the proportions of activities and budget devoted to youth and compare them with your country data on youth population and contraceptive prevalence rates. Use the EIPs to suggest strategies for strengthening  your plan.
      step2:
        title: Start a conversation
        blurb: |-
          Another purpose of the tool is to help you start conversations with each other: young people, health care providers, education officials, community leaders, and  policymakers. Are the reproductive health needs of young people in your community or country being adequately addressed? What share of the reproductive healthcare burden is borne by youth? Does your current plan reflect a proportional concern about this burden? If not, see below!
      step3:
        title: Advocate
        blurb: |-
          A message that emerges clearly from the EIPs is that AYRH thrives in settings where where unbiased services are provided in a welcoming environment, where there is multi-sectoral and community support, and where youth understand their reproductive health needs and have the skills to hold duty-bearers to account. A variety of resources exist to help youth and their adult allies plan effective advocacy campaigns.
